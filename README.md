# Exploring Air Force personnel data
- This works was carried out under Datacamp Workshop introduced by Richie Cotton
- I added extra visulaization and useful codes
--------------------------------------------------------------
**Aim**:  exploring US Department of Defense personnel demographics dataset. 

**Dataset**: The publicly available dataset was taken [from data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/personnel-trends-by-gender-race), and has been cleaned and tidied, so you can get straight into exploratory data analysis.

* The dataset contains counts of military personnel by gender, race, and paygrade. It was compiled in March 2010.
